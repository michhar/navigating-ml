My notes on navigating Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  Note, there are many paths, but these helped me get started.

## Getting Started Blog Articles I Love

Clearly stated and illustrated traditional machine learning, deep learning, and statistics crash course from ML @ Berkeley:
[course found here](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/tutorials/)

The most basic deep learning network.  A network of one neuron by the author of [Python Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka/dp/1783555130/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503038626&sr=8-1&keywords=python+machine+learning) (Sebastian Raschka):  [blog post here](https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_singlelayer_neurons.html)

The 5 Questions Data Science Can Answer by Brandon Rohrer on his excellent blog:  [blog post here](https://brohrer.github.io/five_questions_data_science_answers.html)

## Getting Started in Python and Python for Data Science

### Just Starting Out

[Intro to Python for Data Science from DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) (Time:  ~4 hours)

### Intermediate

[Python for Data Science and Intro to Jupyter Notebooks and on Jupyter Notebooks on Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/rheartpython/libraries/PythonDS101) - Note, solutions to exercises at the end and I wrote this course. (Time: ~15 hours)

For a more in-depth Python course, this is a good one on edX out of UC San Diego:  [Python for Data Science from edX](https://www.edx.org/course/python-data-science-uc-san-diegox-dse200x).  (Time:  10 weeks/8-10 hours per week)
- Basic process of data science
- Python and Jupyter notebooks
- An applied understanding of how to manipulate and analyze uncurated datasets
- Basic statistical analysis and machine learning methods
- How to effectively visualize results

### Advanced

I'll get back with more on this, but in general I like what Jake VanderPlas, a professor at the University of Washington, produces such as this one on Jupyter notebooks with Python, GitHub work, and how to make a Python package among other things with videos: [blog post here](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/03/03/reproducible-data-analysis-in-jupyter/)

## Deep Learning Videos I Love

### Just Starting Out

Melanie Warrick's [Neural Networks for Newbies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-BJSl4zV_g)

Brandon Rohrer's YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrandonRohrer/videos) with tons of deep learning shorts.

A great non-mathy series on YouTube called [Deep Learning SIMPLIFIED](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9OeZkIwhzfv-_Cb7fCikLQ)

### Intermediate

A great Computer Vision course out of Stanford in 2017: [videos here](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)

## Practice Makes Better

### Kaggle Competitions

A lot of folks have recommended [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) to me as they are a great place to stretch your ML muscles and start coding on an fun and exciting challenge.  There are several "start here" problems to begin solving such as [predicting survival on the Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

If you're more advanced there's a nice Computer Vision masking challenge [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge) which closes in September 2017, but the code and data will still be up to check out.
