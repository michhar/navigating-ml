My notes on navigating Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  Note, there are many paths, but these helped me get started.

## Getting Started Blog Articles I Love

Wonderfully worded and illustrated traditional machine learning, deep learning, and statistics crash course:
https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/tutorials/

The most basic deep learning network.  A network of one neuron by the author of [Python Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka/dp/1783555130/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503038626&sr=8-1&keywords=python+machine+learning) (Sebastian Raschka):  http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_singlelayer_neurons.html

The 5 Questions Data Science Can Answer by Brandon Rohrer on his excellent blog:  https://brohrer.github.io/five_questions_data_science_answers.html

## Deep Learning Videos I Love

Melanie Warrick's [Neural Networks for Newbies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-BJSl4zV_g)

more coming soon.

## Getting Started in Python and Python for Data Science

### Just Beginning the Journey

[Intro to Python for Data Science from DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) ~4 hours of work

### Intermediate

[Python for Data Science and Intro to Jupyter Notebooks and on Jupyter Notebooks on Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/rheartpython/libraries/PythonDS101) - Note, solutions to exercises at the end and I wrote this course.  ~15 hours of work

### Advanced

I'll get back with more on this, but in general I like what Jake VanderPlas, a professor at the University of Washington, produces such as this one on Jupyter notebooks with Python, GitHub work, and how to make a Python package among other things with videos: http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/03/03/reproducible-data-analysis-in-jupyter/
