## Prerequisites

1.  Python - yeah so far that's it for now

(2. Algebra, calculus and some basic ML knowledge won't hurt ya)

## Python

### Just Starting Out

**Your first Python course**

[Intro to Python for Data Science from DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) (Time:  ~4 hours)

**Learn about Jupyter notebooks (or even Jupyterlab)**

[Nice, short tour of Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI)
  * Go to [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) to check out Jupyter notebooks live and try to follow along with the video.

### Intermediate

**Python intro and data sciencey tools - go through in order or skip around**

[Python for Data Science and Intro to Jupyter Notebooks and on Jupyter Notebooks on Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/rheartpython/libraries/PythonDS101) - Note, solutions to exercises are in the last notebook. (Time: ~15 hours)

**A different take on Python and data science (either of these should cover your Python needs)**

For a more in-depth Python course, this is a good one on edX out of UC San Diego:  [Python for Data Science from edX](https://www.edx.org/course/python-data-science-uc-san-diegox-dse200x).  (Time:  10 weeks/8-10 hours per week)
- Basic process of data science
- Python and Jupyter notebooks
- An applied understanding of how to manipulate and analyze uncurated datasets
- Basic statistical analysis and machine learning methods
- How to effectively visualize results

### Advanced

**Some books really worth checking out**

For a great dive into Python in the context of ML check out this book by Sebastian Raschka (you'll get to write algorithms from scratch in pure Python!): [Python Machine Learning (2nd Ed.)](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition)

Not sure if this book is out yet, but Sebastian Raschka is writing a sequel with more deep learning and TensorFlow: [Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://leanpub.com/ann-and-deeplearning).
