# Setup

1.  Anaconda3 Python (Recommended versions:  Anaconda3 4.1.1 for Python 3.5.2 recommended, Anaconda3 4.3.1 for Python 3.6 ok, too)
    *  This will allow you to create `conda` environments to "contain" your projects and Python versions.  In fact you can use your current Anaconda or Miniconda Python to install other Python versions from the command line [Ref](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)

2. Jupyter notebook with Python and ML ecosystem (local, service or cloud)

    *  For the first part of the Beginner Challenge, you can use [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) service as your Python environment as it's a Jupyter notebook system and free.  Or you can set up Jupyter notebooks locally with the ML ecosystem (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `opencv-python` etc.).
    * More on Jupyter from their [Docs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

> This is a good chance to build up some Data Science tools locally - nice (from experience) when you have spotty wifi.

3. Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows (avoid Toolbox)
    * This is to aid in creating reproducible setups so you can share with others so they can do it, too!

### Good Idea:

1.  StackOverflow account

## Additional Resources

1.  The Stats/ML StackExchange is a useful place to pose questions about ML and stats [Link](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)
