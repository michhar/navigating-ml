# Setup

For the first part of the Beginner Challenge, you'll only need [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) as an online resource.

For the Workbench parts you'll need some items locally (note:  Workbench is available for Windows or macOS so this is a good chance to build up some Data Science tools locally - nice when you have spotty wifi):

1. Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows (avoid Toolbox)
3. Install [Azure ML Workbench](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/)

Good Idea:

1.  StackOverflow account

### Additional Resources

1.  The Stats/ML StackExchange is a useful place to pose questions [Link](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)
