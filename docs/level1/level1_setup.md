### Hardware and Software

For the first part of the Beginner Challenge, you'll only need [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) as an online resource.

For the Transfer Learning and TensorFlow parts you'll need:

* (Deploy when ready) [Linux (Ubuntu) Deep Learning Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/provision-deep-learning-dsvm) Standard NC6

> Tip: place everything for this set of challenges in the same resource group to tear down together at the end.  Also, stop pricey VMs when youâ€™re no longer using them.

For the Workbench parts you'll need some items locally (note:  Workbench is available for Windows or macOS so this is a good chance to build up some Data Science tools locally - nice when you have spotty wifi):

1. Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows (avoid Toolbox)
3. Install [Azure ML Workbench](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/)

> Plan to work with CNTK locally?  Make sure you check out which versions of Python it works with and note it's for Windows and Ubuntu-flavored Linux as of now.  If you are on a different OS there's a Docker image that is easy to set up and begin right away with CNTK.
 
 3.  CNTK Install - [Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/setup-windows-python?tabs=cntkpy22#installing-cntk-for-python-on-windows)
 
 > TensorFlow can be found on all Linux and Windows Data Science Virtual Machines and Deep Learning Virtual Machines along with a long list of common data science tools - see [Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview)

Good Idea:

1.  StackOverflow account
