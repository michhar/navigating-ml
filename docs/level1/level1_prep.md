# Level 1 Preparation

To begin at this level you should have:

- Familiarity with Python 3 for general purpose programming
- Working knowledge of traditional ML (when to use what)
- Basic data mining skills

## Concepts

### Dealing with Image Data

- Read through this excellent first taste of Image Classification from this Stanford CS231n course [Ref](http://cs231n.github.io/classification/)

### Neural Networks

* Read through [this](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_singlelayer_neurons.html) excellent explanation of a single-layer neural network.  This information will lay the foundation for these sets of challenges and help you get started from the ground-up, quickly with key concepts and Python code snippets.


## Tools

1. Git and GitHub for version control.
2. Jupyter notebook skills. [Chapter 1 Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
1. Get a good grasp of Python for data tasks:
    1. How to read data (matplotlib, Pillow/PIL, opencv)
    2. How to manipulate data (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) 
    3. How to plot data (matplotlib, plotly)
    4. Traditional ML (scikit-learn)

[A Learning Path is under dev to cover the above topics in linear fashion]()



## Additional Resources

### Scikit-Learn

Excellent 3-hr scikit-learn tutorials from PyCon 2015:

- Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7R4HUQ-eQ0) scikit-learn tutorial by Jake VanderPlas (Part 1) and [the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGqGxvqA9-k) tutorial by Olivier Grisel (Part 2).
