Note, there are many paths, but these helped me get started. Working with Images: A CNTK Image Tutorial Path Some Python required Below are links to Jupyter notebooks from the CNTK Tutorials along with accompanying videos by Microsoft around the MNIST digit classification example. Topic Tutorial on Jupyter Video Link Loading MNIST data Notebook 103A on CNTK GitHub Video Reading MNIST data in CNTK Notebook 103B on CNTK GitHub Video Creating and training a logistic regression classifier Notebook 103B on CNTK GitHub Video Predicting on data Notebook 103B on CNTK GitHub Video Training and testing a Multilayer Perceptron Notebook 103C on CNTK GitHub Video Use these notebooks for free online: CNTK Tutorials on Azure Notebooks Use these notebooks locally (note you'll need, among other Python libraries, CNTK installed or in Docker (for macOS)): Download the Jupyter notebook by right clicking \"Raw\" in the upper right-hand corner of the CNTK GitHub repo link above and \"Save link as...\" On command line, navigate to the folder with the notebook, and run jupyter notebook , then open the notebook. An aside, if you have other notebooks you'd like to include in a Docker workflow: If using Docker (as on macOS and following these instructions), make sure to mount any custom folders with your own notebooks when doing the docker run by add the -v flag during that command like in: `docker run -v /Users/micheleenharris/Documents/bin/ -d -p 8888:8888 --name cntk-jupyter-notebooks -t microsoft/cntk:2.0-cpu-python3.5` Additional Places to Go Getting Started Blog Articles I Love Clearly stated and illustrated traditional machine learning, deep learning, and statistics crash course from ML @ Berkeley: course found here The most basic deep learning network. A network of one neuron by the author of Python Machine Learning (Sebastian Raschka): blog post here The 5 Questions Data Science Can Answer by Brandon Rohrer on his excellent blog: blog post here Deep Learning Videos I Love Just Starting Out Melanie Warrick's Neural Networks for Newbies Brandon Rohrer's YouTube channel with tons of deep learning shorts. A great non-mathy series on YouTube called Deep Learning SIMPLIFIED Intermediate A great Computer Vision course out of Stanford in 2017: videos here A good tutorial by Sayan Pathak at Microsoft on the CNTK deep learning Python library here . Practice Makes Better Kaggle Competitions A lot of folks have recommended Kaggle Competitions to me as they are a great place to stretch your ML muscles and start coding on an fun and exciting challenge. There are several \"start here\" problems to begin solving such as predicting survival on the Titanic . If you're more advanced there's a nice Computer Vision masking challenge here which closes in September 2017, but the code and data will still be up to check out.

It's widely used in Linear Algebra applications and has become a de facto library for use in Machine Learning. It uses memory efficiently and is mostly implemented in C, thus is a very efficient option for numerical calculations (see more in Reference #3 by Sebastian Raschka). I've made a list of resources for the numpy library to help someone new or someone in need of a good reference later on. It was created by Travis Oliphant in 2005 (also the creator of SciPy). The package lives on GitHub ( Link ). Listing. In no special order. Quickstart tutorial. From the scipy docs. Short, but good starting point. Ref Introduction to NumPy. A nice whole chapter on numpy by Jake VanderPlas. Ref Introduction to Numpy. A really nice quick tour as an appendix to a deep learning book by Sebastian Raschka Ref and as a Notebook Numerical Scientific Computing. Quick tour with exercises by Micheleen Harris.
