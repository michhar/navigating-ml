### Hardware and Software

For the first part of the Beginner Challenge, you'll only need [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) as an online resource.

For the Transfer Learning and TensorFlow parts you'll need:

* (Deploy when ready) [Linux (Ubuntu) Deep Learning Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/provision-deep-learning-dsvm) Standard NC6
> Tip: place everything for this set of challenges in the same resource group to tear down together at the end.

For the Workbench parts you'll need some items locally (note:  Workbench is available for Windows or macOS so this is a good chance to build up some Data Science tools locally - nice when you have spotty wifi):

1. Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows (avoid Toolbox)
3. Install [Azure ML Workbench](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/)

> Plan to work with CNTK locally (Right now only for Windows and Ubuntu-flavored Linux)?  If you do not have a Anaconda3 Python installation, install [Anaconda3 4.1.1 Python for Windows (64-bit)](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64.exe) (CNTK has also been tested with Anaconda3 4.3.1 with Python version 3.6 and [other](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/setup-windows-python?tabs=cntkpy22#installing-cntk-for-python-on-windows) Python versions).

Good Idea:

1. StackOverflow account
