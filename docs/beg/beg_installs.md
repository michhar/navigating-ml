### Hardware and Software

For most of the Beginner Challenge, you'll only need [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) as an online resource.

For the Transfer Learning and TensorFlow parts you'll need:

* (Deploy when ready) [Linux (Ubuntu) Deep Learning Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/provision-deep-learning-dsvm) Standard NC6
> Tip: place everything for this set of challenges in the same resource group to tear down together at the end.

For the Workbench parts you'll need some items locally (note:  Workbench is available for Windows or macOS only so this is a good chance to build up some tools locally - nice when you have spotty wifi):

1. Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows (avoid Toolbox)
2. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
3. Install [Azure ML Workbench](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/)

Good Idea:

1. StackOverflow account
