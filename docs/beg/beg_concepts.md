# Concepts

1. Git and GitHub for version control.
2. Jupyter notebook skillz.
1. Get a good grasp of Python for:
    1. How to read data (matplotlib, Pillow, opencv)
    2. How to manipulate data (numpy, pandas)
    3. How to plot data (matplotlib, plotly)
    4. Traditional ML
        - Learn about ML and Python scikit-learn in this [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A)
3. Learn concepts around neural networks for image applications.
    1.  List the ways in which Object Detection differs from Image Classification and Instance Segmentation.
    2.  List the differences between a Convolutional and regular Dense Neural Network.
    3.  Design a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) breaking it down into parts such as the filter, placement of the convolution layers, ReLU layers, pooling layers, and fully-connected layers.  Apply window stride and size appropriately.
    4.  List the reasons to use Transfer Learning over "from scratch" model definitions.
