# A List of `numpy` resources

NumPy stands for Numerical Python.  It's widely used in Linear Algebra applications and has become a _de facto_ library for use in Machine Learning.  It uses memory efficiently and is mostly implemented in C, thus is a very efficient option for numerical calculations (see more in Reference #3 by Sebastian Raschka).  I've made a list of resources for the `numpy` library to help someone new or someone in need of a good reference later on.  It was created by Travis Oliphant in 2005 (also the creator of SciPy).  The package lives on GitHub ([Link](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)).

## Listing.  In no special order.

1.  Quickstart tutorial.  From the `scipy` docs.  Short, but good starting point. [Ref](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html)
2.  Introduction to NumPy.  A nice whole chapter on `numpy` by Jake VanderPlas. [Ref](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html)
3.  Introduction to Numpy.  A really nice quick tour as an appendix to a deep learning book by Sebastian Raschka [Ref](https://sebastianraschka.com/pdf/books/dlb/appendix_f_numpy-intro.pdf) and as a [Notebook](https://github.com/rasbt/deep-learning-book/blob/master/code/appendix_f_numpy-intro/appendix_f_numpy-intro.ipynb)
3.  Numerical Scientific Computing.  Quick tour with exercises by Micheleen Harris.  [Notebook](https://notebooks.azure.com/rheartpython/libraries/PythonDS101/html/07.NumericalScientificComputing.ipynb)

Exercise:  Follow along with these courses by doing things concurrently in `numpy`.

There are likely many more great resources out there so feel free to create an issue on this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/michhar/navigating-ml/issues) letting me know about yours or others.
