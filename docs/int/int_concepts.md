# Concepts

Learn about CNTK and logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and CNN classifiers on the MNIST dataset to classify hand-written digits.  We'll use these notebooks in our Challenge section.

Take the first four modules of the free Deep Learning Explained edX [course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT236x+4T2017/course/).  Each module should take 1-2 hours so consider this pre-work to take about 1 full day.

1. Learn concepts around neural networks for image applications.
    1.  List the differences between a Convolutional (ConvNet/CNN) and regular Dense Neural Network.
    2.  List the tunable hyperparameters one can find in a ConvNet.
