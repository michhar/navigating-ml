# Level 2 Preparation

Now it's time to really learn about PyTorch and classifiers such as logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and convolutional network (CNN/ConvNet) classifiers.  The MNIST hand-written digits dataset is used in the following course to classify grey-scale images of digits.  We'll use this code in our Challenge section so go ahead and get familiar with it now by taking this course.

1. Learn concepts around neural networks for image applications and be able to answer these questions.
    1.  List the differences between a Convolutional (ConvNet/CNN) and regular Dense Neural Network.
    2.  List and give examples of the tunable hyperparameters one can find in a ConvNet.
