# Level 2 Preparation

Now it's time to really learn about CNTK and classifiers such as logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and convolutional network (CNN/ConvNet) classifiers.  The MNIST hand-written digits dataset is used in the following course to classify grey-scale images of digits.  We'll use this code in our Challenge section so go ahead and get familiar with it now by taking this course.

Work through the first four modules of the free Deep Learning Explained edX [course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT236x+4T2017/course/).  Each module should take 1-2 hours each.

1. Learn concepts around neural networks for image applications.
    1.  List the differences between a Convolutional (ConvNet/CNN) and regular Dense Neural Network.
    2.  List and give examples of the tunable hyperparameters one can find in a ConvNet.
    ...


### For Quick Reference - MNIST Digits and CNTK Notebooks and Videos

Below are links to some of the Jupyter notebooks used in the edX Deep Learning Explained course (linked to above) using the MNIST hand-written digits dataset.  Included are links to accompanying videos by Microsoft data scientists around this example.

They are meant to be worked on in order, each tutorial building on the previous.  Ideally, you will have also watched the accompanying lectures from the course.
