# Level 2 Challenge

In this intermediate Challenge, you'll apply what you've learned in the Level 2 Preparation section, leveraging the Jupyter notebooks you became familiar with in the course.  You'll start exploring the CIFAR-10 dataset along with other datsets in PyTorch and TensorFlow as extra credit.

## Adapt Deep Learning Code

### Image Classification

Instructions to practice image classification with PyTorch

2. Let's dive into some code.  Log into the Jupyter (on your DSVM or locally)
  - In a code cell `! git clone https://github.com/rasbt/deep-learning-book.git`
  - Open this notebook:  `/code/model_zoo/pytorch_ipynb/multilayer-perceptron.ipynb`
  - Modify the notebook to work with the CIFAR-10
    * Remember you're working with RGB images instead of grayscale
  - What is the resulting average test error?  Why is this value so different from the MNIST result?  What hyperparameters can you modify to fix this?

#### Extra Credit

1. Go online and find 5 png's of cats and dogs.  Reshape them and pad them to be 32x32 pixels using the Python Pillow library (see [ImageOps](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/ImageOps.html)). Test the network with these, following the guidelines and lessons you learned thus far.  Now find an image of a coconut or lime and test the network with this.  What is wrong with using a food image?
2. Create a new label called "food" and add this [fruit dataset](http://www.vicos.si/Downloads/FIDS30), leaving some out of training for testing.  Try your coconut image again.  What if now you tested with a hot dog image?

## Transfer Learning with PyTorch

Here, for ease of use and speed we'll use Transfer Learning as well.

1. Take [this](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html) tutorial to work with Inception v3 as the base model (model [choices](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html)) - write code to load the model, count the features going in to a fully connected layer (last layer of the CNN) and reset it to a Linear layer to thus unfreeze the layer for transfer learning)
2.  Using the CIFAR-10 dataset from PyTorch `datasets`, train an Inception v3 model to classify trucks and automobiles (just a two-class classifier from the 10 classes in CIFAR).
