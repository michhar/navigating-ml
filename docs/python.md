# Prerequisites

1.  Python 3 (Rocks!)

(2. Algebra, calculus and some basic ML knowledge won't hurt ya)

## Python

### Just Starting Out

**Your first Python course**

[Intro to Python for Data Science from DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) (Time:  ~4 hours)

  * Python basics
  * Lists
  * Functions and packages
  * Numpy

**Learn about Jupyter**

[Nice, short video tour of Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI)

  * Go to [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) to check out Jupyter notebooks live and try to follow along with the video.

### Intermediate

**Python intro and data sciencey tools - go through in order or skip around**

[Python for Data Science and Intro to Jupyter Notebooks and on Jupyter Notebooks on Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/rheartpython/libraries/PythonDS101) - Note, solutions to exercises are in the last notebook. (Time: ~15 hours)

* Basics
* Data Structures
* Functional Programming
* Sorting and Pattern Matching
* Object Oriented Programming
* Basic Difference from 2 to 3
* Numerical Computing
* Data Analysis with pandas I
* Data Analysis with pandas II
* Machine Learning I - ML Basics and Data Exploration
* Machine Learning II - Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
* Machine Learning III - Parameter Tuning and Model Evaluation
* Visualization

**A different take on Python and data science (either of these should cover your Python needs)**

For a more in-depth Python course, this is a good one on edX out of UC San Diego:  [Python for Data Science from edX](https://www.edx.org/course/python-data-science-uc-san-diegox-dse200x).  (Time:  10 weeks/8-10 hours per week)

* Basic process of data science
* Python and Jupyter notebooks
* An applied understanding of how to manipulate and analyze uncurated datasets
* Basic statistical analysis and machine learning methods
* How to effectively visualize results

### Numerical Python, a.k.a. using the `numpy` package, is essential for the data scientist

See my [python/numpy.html](python/numpy) article for a detailed list of `numpy` resources.

### Advanced

**Some books really worth checking out**

For a great dive into Python in the context of ML check out this book by Sebastian Raschka (you'll get to write algorithms from scratch in pure Python!): [Python Machine Learning (2nd Ed.)](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition)

Not sure if this book is out yet, but Sebastian Raschka is writing a sequel with more deep learning in Python with TensorFlow: [Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://leanpub.com/ann-and-deeplearning).

"This book is concerned with the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python. My goal is to offer a guide to the parts of the Python programming language and its data-oriented library ecosystem and tools that will equip you to become an effective data analyst. While 'data analysis' is in the title of the book, the focus is specifically on Python programming, libraries, and tools as opposed to data analysis methodology. This is the Python programming you need for data analysis."  [Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython by Wes McKinney](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662/)

"Perhaps you would like to give your homemade robot a brain of its own? Make it recognize faces? Or learn to walk around? Or maybe your company has tons of data (user logs, financial data, production data, machine sensor data, hotline stats, HR reports, etc.), and more than likely you could unearth some hidden gems if you just knew where to look." [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems by Aurélien Géron](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291)
