Do you feel like there's just too much to be aware of in the Deep Learning space today?  Concepts like Convolutional Neural Networks, GANs, Neuro Style...and networks like AlexNet, ResNet, or Inception...frameworks like CNTK, TensorFlow, Caffe2, PyTorch...extra layers on top of those like TensorFlow Slim or Sonnet, Keras, Gluon, MMLSpark...

It can really seem overwhelming.  I propose we step back, take a nice deep breath, and make a decision.  Are you a beginner in this field?  Are you about middling of the road?  Or are you an seasoned pro conceptually, but not super familiar with CNTK or TensorFlow (plus the Hardware and current tools for this kind of work)?

So, you suspect you are a Beginner in this field.  Do you need some Python knowledge and fast?  Go to the Getting Started section and then move on to the Beginner Challenge for Dealing with Images to start building up your deep learning experience.

Are you aware of the basics of ML and perhaps what a fully-connected neural network is?  Have you had some exposure to TensorFlow?  But perhaps you don't have deep working knowledge of Convolutional Neural Networks, yet?  In that case, try jumping into the Intermediate section of Dealing with Images.  If it seems a little overwhelming, head back to the Beginner area.  If it's not challenging enough, move on to the Advanced section.

Maybe you're a total neural network geek and you've played with CNTK and TensorFlow a little bit now, built some custom models with these frameworks.  But maybe you haven't set up your environment to include a GPU or two.  Or perhaps you haven't performed image augmentation for input readers in CNTK or created a live REST endpoint and app to call your model?  These are tasks you'll likely encounter once you start working with partners and customers for building custom ML models.  They will want something deployed.  But don't worry, this set of Challenges are built to get you most of the way there and hopefully hungry for more deep learning knowledge.

> Tip:  Focus on the pipeline first and iterate on the model after.

Here, you'll get exposed to several types, qualities and sizes of datasets.  You'll also use many useful Python libraries and general Data Science tools.  These paths can be used separately or as one big, ML onboarding.  They are intended to help you get up and running for ML partner hacks quickly and thoroughly.

That being said, feedback is always welcome especially at this early stage.  Please enjoy responsibly.

### Data

| Dataset | Description | Link |
|:------|:------|:------|
| Fashion MNIST Dataset (Source: Kaggle) | The Fashion MNIST dataset is a good one to move on to from the hand-written digits one.  It has 60,000 28x28 training images and 10,000 test images as csv files. | [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/data) |
| Fruit Dataset (FIDS30) | The fruit image data set consists of 971 images of common fruit. The images are classified into 30 different fruit classes. | [Link](http://www.vicos.si/Downloads/FIDS30) |
| CIFAR-10 (Source: Kaggle) | The CIFAR-10 data consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images in this official data. | [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10/data) |
